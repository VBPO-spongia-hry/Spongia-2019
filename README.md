# Naval Transport Simulator
Welcome to the Naval transport simulator, commander!
Your goal here is to build a great trading empire, with ships carrying various cargo to and from many different islands. 
Each island has its own production rates for each of the ten types of cargo (wheat, leather, wood, fish, fruit, meat, iron, silk, spices and exotic fruit), but they have their own needs as well. 
Build ships, plan routes, earn money, unlock better ship parts, and repeat!
Gain as much money as you can in about twenty minutes, then feel free to try again and improve! Or you can try endless mode.
Ships may sink, thus using the best parts is highly recommended :)
